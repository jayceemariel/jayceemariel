Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# I'm Mariel

I'm a sophomore at Ateneo de Manila University currently taking BS Management Information Systems as my undergrad. I have always had a passion in designing and creating pieces for the funs.

During 2022, I collaborated with @ezerssss in creating a UI design for the batch Palanca. You can find the UI [Here](https://github.com/ezerssss/Gayang-Mingor-Palanca).
